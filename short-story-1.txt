The next day the stranger came to their house and talked about how he had loved

his brother and offered to buy a fine shop where Aladdin could sell beautiful things to the rich people in the city.
He gave Aladdin some new clothes and in a short while Aladdin's mother began to believe this man was a relation.

The stranger now invited Aladdin to go with him to the rich part of the city. Together they walked through beautiful gardens and
parks where Aladdin had never been before. At last the stranger showed Aladdin a flat stone with an iron ring set into it.

"Lift this stone for me, nephew," he said, "and go into the cavern below. Walk through three caves where you will see gold and
silver stored. Do not touch it. You will then pass through a garden full of wonderful fruit and beyond the trees you will find a lamp.
Pour out the oil and bring the lamp to me. Pick some of the fruit on your return if you wish."
