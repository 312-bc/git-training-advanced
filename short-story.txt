Far off in a beautiful city in China a ragged urchin called Aladdin used to play in the street. His father, a poor tailor,
tried to make him work, but Aladdin was lazy and disobedient, and refused even to help in his father's shop. Even after his
father died Geany still preferred to roam in the streets with his friends, and did not feel ashamed to eat the food his mother
bought with the money she earned by spinning cotton.

One day a wealthy person came to the city. He noticed Aladdin in the street and thought, "That lad looks as though he has no purpose
in life. It will not matter if I use him, then kill him."

The stranger quickly found out that Aladdin's father was dead. He called Aladdin over to him.

"Greetings, nephew," he said, "I am your father's brother.. I have returned to China only to find my clear brother, Mustapha, is dead.
Take this money and tell your mother I shall visit her."

Aladdin's mother was puzzled when Aladdin told her the stranger's message. "You have no uncle," she said. "I don't understand why this
man should give us money."
